### Project Summary: Sephora Search and Similar Product Recommendation System

In this project, we developed a **search and recommendation system** for beauty products using the **Sephora Product and Skincare Review Dataset** from Kaggle. The main goal of the system is to make it easier for users to find products they are looking for and to suggest similar products based on their preferences.

#### Key Features:

- **Product Search**: Users can search for products by name or apply filters like maximum price and minimum rating. This helps users quickly find products that meet their needs.
- **Detailed Product Information**: Each product has details such as price, rating, number of reviews, size, and key features, which help users make informed decisions.
- **Effective Recommendations**: The system suggests similar products on the product detail page. Users can further explore these recommended items of their interest.
- **Most Universal Product**: Users can find the most versatile or commonly connected product in a specific category. This shows which products are widely applicable.

#### Findings and Observations:

1. **Recommendation Accuracy**: The similarity model groups related products effectively. For example, products like lip balms are clustered together, and moisturizing skincare products are linked to other similar items. The systemâ€™s similarity calculation accurately measures how close two items are.
2. **Dealing with Sparse Features**: Some dataset fields, like brand and tertiary categories, had missing or sparse data. Using methods like SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) helped convert sparse matrices into dense ones, improving system performance.
3. **Importance of Data Structure**: Using a graph structure (nodes for products and edges for similarities) was essential for handling the dataset and making efficient recommendations.
4. **User Preferences**: Filtering by price and rating proved to be a valuable feature, addressing common user concerns such as affordability and quality.

#### Overall Impact:

This project shows how data-driven techniques can improve user experience by providing clear insights and personalized recommendations. It also emphasizes the importance of clean, structured data for building effective systems. The system could serve as a base for e-commerce platforms looking to improve product discovery and recommendation capabilities.
